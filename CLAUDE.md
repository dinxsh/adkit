# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is an **autonomous AI bidding system** where intelligent agents compete for Basenames using the x402 payment protocol. Agents make strategic bidding decisions powered by Claude (Anthropic) and LlamaIndex, with blockchain payments via x402 on Base Sepolia.

**Core Innovation**: Refunds act as economic signals - when an agent is outbid, they receive a USDC refund which triggers automatic re-evaluation and counter-bidding.

## Architecture

### Three Main Components

1. **Next.js Server** (`app/api/`)
   - Accepts bids via x402 payment protocol
   - Verifies and settles payments on-chain
   - Issues refunds to outbid agents
   - Stores real-time events in MongoDB
   - Manages auction state in MongoDB

2. **Intelligent Agents** (`agents/`)
   - Autonomous bidding agents powered by Claude AI
   - Use LlamaIndex ReActAgent framework with custom tools
   - Monitor blockchain for refunds (economic signals)
   - Make strategic decisions based on auction context

3. **Frontend Dashboard** (`app/auction/[basename]/`)
   - Real-time polling of auction events from MongoDB
   - Shows agent thinking, bids, and reflections
   - iMessage-style chat interface

### Payment Flow (x402 Protocol)

```
Agent → No payment header → Server responds 402 + requirements
Agent → Signs EIP-3009 authorization → Retries with X-PAYMENT header
Server → Verifies payment → Settles on-chain → Refunds previous bidder
Previous bidder → Detects refund (balance increase) → Triggers re-bid
```

**Critical**: Always use Context7 MCP to study x402 docs when dealing with payment-related errors.

## Development Commands

## Important Patterns

### Settlement Lock
The server uses a settlement lock to prevent "replacement transaction underpriced" errors when multiple agents bid simultaneously:
```typescript
const settlementLocks = new Map<string, Promise<any>>();
// Agents wait for previous settlement before proceeding
```

### Economic Signaling
Refunds trigger agent re-evaluation without polling:
```typescript
// Agent monitors USDC balance every 2s
const newBalance = await getUSDCBalance();
if (newBalance > lastBalance) {
  console.log('🔔 REFUND DETECTED');
  // Re-evaluate and potentially re-bid
}
```

### Proposal Negotiation
Agents propose bid amounts before payment:
```typescript
// Agent sends X-Proposed-Bid header
// Server evaluates and returns 402 with negotiation context
// Agent decides whether to proceed with payment
```

### Event Flow (MongoDB Polling)
```
Agent thinks → store 'thinking' event → UI polls → UI shows bubble
Agent pays → store 'bid_placed' event → UI polls → UI shows bid card (loading)
Agent reflects → store 'reflection' event → UI polls → UI updates bid card
Server refunds → store 'refund' event → UI polls → UI shows notification
```

**Polling Frequency**: All frontend pages poll `/api/events/[adSpotId]` every 2 seconds for real-time updates.

## Blockchain Details

- **Network**: Base Sepolia (testnet for payments), Base Mainnet (for Basename transfers)
- **Token**: USDC (`0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e` on Base Sepolia)
- **Payment Scheme**: x402 "exact" scheme using EIP-3009 (Transfer with Authorization)
- **Gas**: CDP wallets use Coinbase paymaster for gasless operations

## x402 Integration

**IMPORTANT**: When experiencing errors with x402 requests, use Context7 MCP:
1. `resolve-library-id` for x402
2. `get-library-docs` with the library ID
3. Study current protocol specs for proper request formatting

### x402 Headers

**Request Headers**:
- `X-PAYMENT`: EIP-3009 payment authorization (created by x402-axios)
- `X-Agent-ID`: Agent identifier for tracking
- `X-Proposed-Bid`: Proposed bid amount (for negotiation)
- `X-Strategy-Reasoning`: Agent's reasoning for proposal

**Response Headers**:
- `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE`: Settlement response from facilitator

## Testing & Debugging

### Check Agent USDC Balance
```bash
# View on Base Sepolia explorer
open https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/[AGENT_WALLET_ADDRESS]
```

### Check Transaction
```bash
# View settlement/refund transactions
open https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/[TX_HASH]
```

### MongoDB Queries
```javascript
// View current auction state
db.bidRecords.findOne({ basename: "x402agent.base.eth" })
```

### Common Issues

1. **"Replacement transaction underpriced"**: Settlement lock prevents this, but if it happens, agents are bidding too fast. The lock will queue them.

2. **"Payment verification failed"**: Check agent USDC balance and allowance. Use Context7 MCP to verify x402 protocol compliance.

3. **Refunds not working**: Ensure server wallet has USDC for refunds. Check transaction logs.

4. **Agent not re-bidding after refund**: Check balance monitoring loop (2s interval). Verify agent hasn't hit max bid limit.

5. **Events not updating in UI**: Check browser DevTools Network tab for polling requests to `/api/events/[adSpotId]` every 2 seconds. Verify MongoDB connection and event storage.

## Withdrawal System

Agents can dynamically withdraw from auctions:
- LLM detects decision not to bid (keywords: "not to place", "withdrawing", "accept this loss")
- Agent sends withdrawal request with reasoning
- Server validates (can't withdraw if currently winning)
- Server issues USDC refund
- If only 1 active bidder remains → auction ends

## Notes for Future Development

- Basename transfer to winner (Base Mainnet) is specified but not yet implemented
- Consider rate limiting on bid endpoint for production
- MongoDB indexes recommended for performance at scale
- Current system uses simple agents vs intelligent agents - intelligent agents provide strategic decision-making
- The settlement lock is in-memory; for multi-instance deployments, use Redis or similar
