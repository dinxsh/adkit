            Specifies the type of proxy to use.

             - **basic**: Proxies for scraping sites with none to basic anti-bot solutions. Fast and usually works.
             - **stealth**: Stealth proxies for scraping sites with advanced anti-bot solutions. Slower, but more reliable on certain sites. Costs up to 5 credits per request.
             - **auto**: Firecrawl will automatically retry scraping with stealth proxies if the basic proxy fails. If the retry with stealth is successful, 5 credits will be billed for the scrape. If the first attempt with basic is successful, only the regular cost will be billed.

            If you do not specify a proxy, Firecrawl will default to auto.
          default: auto

            If true, the page will be stored in the Firecrawl index and cache.
            Setting this to false is useful if your scraping activity may have
            data protection concerns. Using some parameters associated with
            sensitive scraping (actions, headers) will force this parameter to
            be false.
          default: true
